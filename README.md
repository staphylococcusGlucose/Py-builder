# Py-builder
C-Build Program with Python

## How do I use it?
Open compile_lists.py
Then there's going to be a bunch of weird variables and lists
Let's take a look at each one
1. PROGRAM variable
It's a variable that determines what name you're going to get the results at the end. You can name them as you like
2. COMPILER_NAME 
This is asking what compiler you're going to use. I recommend clang or gcc
3. FLAGS
It's a place where you write which flag to apply to compile
-You don't have to write down c. Basically, when you compile, you put -c in it
4. SUB-DIR
Actually, it doesn't matter if I leave it blank, but it's a list I made because it can be useful for managing this next list
5. FILES
You just have to put what files to compile here. First of all, I recommend putting the file with the main function at the front
